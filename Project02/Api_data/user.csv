DJ, Producer and Event organizer from Finland with over a decade of experience in spinning drum 'n' bass and jungle.

All things started from late 90's. Just messing around with vinyl but steadily progressing from being on of the winners in couple of mixtape to what it is now. Laiska Jaakko has played among many international names. Likes of Audio, Panacea, Ulterior Motive, Dj Storm, BTK, Bryan G and Jade to name a few. He throws events in Garage, Unohdus and Satama collectives since 2002.

He is also one of Basso radios hosts at Viidakkorumpu crew/ Basso Drum & Bass Show.

Expect a diverse selection of music but always the selection is based on the event whatever it is. This guy is guaranteed to make every basshead dancing through the night.

มันยากจะหาคำอธิบาย It so hard to meaning
เรื่องบางสิ่งบางอย่างก็ไม่จำเป็นต้องไปเข้าใจมัน
ขอแค่วันนี้ให้เพียงแค่เธอกับฉันแค่เราสองคนเข้าใจกัน
ฉันยอมทำทุกอย่างเพื่อแลกกับรอยยิ้มบนหน้าเธอ
ทำทุกหนทางให้ใจชั้นได้เข้าไปใกล้เธอ
อยากจะบอกกับเธอว่าเธอสำคัญที่สุด
ไม่ได้คุยแค่วันเดียวแต่กลับทำเอาผมนั้นเพ้อไม่หยุด
แอบไปตามดูใน Facebook,Twiiter 
กด Like ทุกความเห็นเพื่อให้เธอรู้ฉัน Miss เธอ
อย่าให้คิดเก้อ อย่าให้ฉันคิดไปไกลเกิน
อย่าล้อเล่นกับความรู้สึกถ้าเธอไม่คิดจะเกินเลย
แล้วเธอล่ะเป็นยังไงเธอคิดเหมือนกันรึเปล่า
แต่ไม่จำเป็นต้องตอบฉันว่าเธอน่ะแคร์มันเหมือนกันรึเปล่า
ให้ฉันได้อยู่ในโลกแห่งจินตการของฉันเอง
และให้เวลาเป็นตัวกำหนดทิศทางของตัวมันเอง ... ( ซ้ำ * . ** )

ไม่ใช่ Superstar ไม่ใช่ดารา เป็นคนธรรมดาแล้วใครคนไหนล่ะที่อยากจะมองมา
But this is me babyถ้าฉันเป็นของฉันแบบนี้แล้ว Can you love me baby?
ตอนที่เธอไม่สบายใจฉันยืนอยู่ข้างเธอและตอนที่ชั้นทุกข์ใจก็มีเธอเคียงข้างชั้นเสมอ
เธอไม่จำเป็นต้องพูดอะไร แค่ให้ฉันอยู่ใกล้เธอแค่นั้นชั้นก็อุ่นใจ

151,571737132,https://soundcloud.com/spectralquartz,Spectral Quartz,Jakub,,,"Spectral Quartz is a psytrance project of 26y.o. Slovakian guy mainly based in London(UK).  His passion for music started when he was teenager and used to hang out with Punks listening to Hardcore music. As we evolve like human beings, about his 20s he discovered dark side of drum and bass and started his first hard drum and bass project. Sooner after he realized the tempo and vibe of this music is not really what he is into and he randomly discovered the psytrance scene and fell in love with it. He was always amazed by sound and psytrance music offered him a wide range of frequencies.

This project is mainly focused on psytrance, as the name says the sound is very spectral and unique. The producer mixes melodic aspects with very noisy ones in really bassy and pulsating way. Music contains rich basslines and is somwhere between light and dark psytrance. Whole idea is to keep balance, Ying-Yang. 

The production can be influenced by various genres, artist is really open in case of music and music styles varieties. So you can hear bit sparks of other styles or some ethnic influences.

Based in Malaga, Andalusia, in the south of the peninsula, where in the 90s and part of the 2000s the BreakBeat sounded at full volume on every radio, car or rave, we could not avoid going through a stage of our youth in which the Broken rhythms will flood our lives We DJ, dance and produce thousands of hours and songs of this very energetic and special genre.


All that remained in our musical DNA and today we need to air it and share it. That is the reason for being of UnBeat Records. Electro, hardcore, garage, drum & bass or jungle, among other genres, have a place in this new channel that follows the Guerrilla Records line.

Después de jugar con las pletinas de Cd’s, allá por el 2005 llega a sus manos una controladora con la que seguirá descubriendo la nueva era que se estaba forjando en la escena musical.

Ya en 2009 da el salto a la escena en locales de su provincia de la mano de una comunidad dj que organizaba fiestas de música cañera en toda la región, al ser el único de la formación que pinchaba techno, no fue difícil que al poco tiempo empezara en solitario a trabajar en más locales de su zona y alrededores.

Empieza a descubrir nuevos estilos como el tech-house y el progressive, esto hace que conecte más con la gente y sepa leer el ambiente en cada evento, además empieza a sentir feeling con sus oyentes y recibe un gran feedback que le hace seguir innovando hacia el big room y edm, todo ello empieza a repercutirle en forma de actuaciones en eventos privados y matrimoniales, dando un nuevo enfoque y descubriendo nuevas formas de sentir tanto la música como la forma de actuar.

GeNeeR was born in a spot in La Mancha with the illusion of listening to music all the time. At the age of 12, he discovered all the good music from the 90's to 00's through his older brother.
After playing with the CD decks, back in 2005 a controller came to his hands with which he would continue to discover the new era that was being forged in the music scene.

Already in 2009 he made the leap to the scene in venues in his province at the hands of a dj community that organized cane music parties throughout the region, being the only one of the formation that played techno, it was not difficult that soon after He will start alone to work in more places in his area and surroundings.

He begins to discover new styles such as tech-house and progressive, this makes him connect more with people and know how to read the environment in each event, he also begins to feel a feeling with his listeners and receives great feedback that makes him continue to innovate towards the big room and edm, all this begins to affect him in the form of performances in private and wedding events, giving a new approach and discovering new ways of feeling both the music and the way of acting.",False,119,232,31,0,106,84

It is in Bayonne that the electronic music duo GBxCL (Geoff Blank & Chute Libre) was created. Coming from different styles of music like hardcore punk and electro, the duo has a wide spectrum of inspirations. After exploring the world of synthwave, they kept their passion for synthesisers but gradually oriented themselves towards a dark and powerful techno always aiming for the best quality of its sound design.

Fascinated by the technology at the time and by records, he becoming DJ was rather inevitable. At the age of 5 he even caused uproar in a department store just to get his very first record player. He dedicated all his pocket money to records, every birthday present absolutely had to be some kind of audio equipment. “I was truly possessed by music and the phenomenon radio. I definitely needed to know more about it.” 

At the age of 14 he got the opportunity to edit commercials on a local radio stations and to mix non-stop programmes. That allowed him to gain an insight into the technique and the story behind the radio. But a small party where he first took place behind the turntable was the true eye-opener. “The audience that is listening, dancing and having fun on the music you play, really gives you an intense feeling of happiness.” Soon afterwards he was playing every Saturday in a student bar where he could eat his heart out experimenting.

When he was 17, he entered a large disco for the first time in his life. “An unforgettable experience, which really turned my world upside down. I kept watching the DJ who was playing and perfectly controlling the crowd, full of admiration.”

Soon afterwards Laurent received all kinds of offers : company parties, student parties, clubs,…. Every night was different and therefore he also had to broaden his knowledge of the most diverse music genres. “I’ve always intended to play for an audience, to ensure the success of every single party.” 

Laurent masters nearly every music style and as no other he knows how to make the crowd dance. In the meanwhile he has built up an impressive record of leading club residences. 

Since 2005 Laurent Wery is also involved in the production of mixed compilations. Today you can find Laurent Wery tracks in the stores around the world. What's next?",False,1285,949,44,32,112,58

Leave a like, comment and share if you like what you hear, it will keep me motivated to continue recording High quality live sets for YOU!

Hi I'm Evert de Bruin(Ravert) and I have a big passion for the harder styles of dance music.
I love discussing about Hardstyle or helping other DJ/Producers so don't be shy and start a conversation on Facebook. 

Biography:
Hi my name is Evert de Bruin(Ravert) and for as long as I can remember I listened to the harder styles in dance music.
In December 2012 I bought a 2xCDJ's-2000 & DJM-2000,  since then I started to post al of my recordings on soundcloud and other social media to promote myself.
Thanks to that and winning a DJ contest I performed at party's such as: The Art of Dance event: Rauw op je dak and Crazyland's: Pleasure Island Festival.

I make full use of all the functions on the DJM and CDJ's, especially the cue points that allows you to easily mix many songs together in a short period of time. Or make live edit's and mash-up's.

The styles I prefer are RAWhardstyle and Millennium Hardcore, but the latest releases in the Mainstream Hardstyle are also closely monitored by me. 
I also have a large assortment of early hardstyle and Hardcore.

Since July 2013 I am trying to produce my own tracks, I was really making progress but since the birth of my daughter in august of 2017 I haven't found the time to work on my skills.
I hope you guys got the patience to wait till I'm back.

Having watched his heroes over the years playing at the Arches in Glasgow, Tookie decided to take up djing as a hobby around 10 years ago initially as a hobby to listen back to some of the anthems from his clubbing days.

During lockdown Tookie found himself with more time on his hands and used this to start weekly live streams. It wasn't too long before he started working with the Trance Junkiez team as a resident.

Today you can hear Tookie on the Trance Junkiez twitch channel or on the Revolution of Dance Radio station. He has also featured as a guest on Irish Trance Family, Vibez.live, COVID Dance Nights and Liquid House.

Over the next year expect to see and hear a lot more of Tookie as we move from online streams into a club environment.",False,134,494,16,0,304,138

Nun stehst du da ..und fragst was ich will ?!?
Ich sagte: Ohren, einen Verstand und etwas Taktgefühl !
Du fragst mich, warum nehm ich dich ins Visier - Weil ich dich liebe... ist doch klar..deshalb bin ich hier.
Nimm doch die Blinden-Brille ab und mir das Blatt vorm Mund...
So treten meine Worte endlich aus dem Hintergrund ...
Und direkt in dein Herz, wo sie hingehören !
... endlich mal beginnen deine unruhe zu stören ...
Ich kann nicht ewig bleiben, ja ich muss bald gehn...
Doch vorher muss ich sicher sein, dass wir uns wieder sehn !
Aber nicht eine Fassade, die von Liebe spricht ....
Ich will sie spüren, und zwar aus deinem Augenlicht !

While starting Dj´ing in the middle of the 90ties (aka Chris Farell) in the south of Germany and playing vinyls of Soulful-, Funky-, Disco-House mostly in smaller underground clubs in Karlsruhe, Stuttgart and Munich, Chris was one of the founders and organizers of the yearly LOVETRAINS to the #LOVEPARADE in Berlin.

By now his repertoire ranges from Minimal to House and across DeepTech to the point of elegant TechHouse. Each set is full of soul and with a perfect rhythm for the dancefloor. He likes it best to combine these genres with organic sounds like Balearic- and AfroHouse, Disco and Funk.

As USP Chris created his very own and special style which he named #OrganicDeepTech.

Since 2018 Chris is working on founding new projects in underground electronic music and finally performing again in clubs and open air festivals in Palma, Ibiza, Barcelona, Madrid, Stettin, Berlin including several Radioshows on #IbizaGlobalRadio.

First releases are planned for soonish.

As founder of the underground labels #BalearicFreaks and #berlin.music Chris is working on organizing important event productions in Berlin, the south of Germany and on Palma & Ibiza.

What characterizes Chris el Raton as an artist and event manager is professionalism and experience combined with good flavor for electronic music.",False,1418,163,22,1,160,39

Papa Si

Papa Si has been DJing electronic music for many years. His first love is house music but he has the ability and versatility to play in a variety of styles such as breaks, hard dance, drum ‘n’ bass and trance and often draws on elements of these genres in his house sets. Si embraces technology and has been known to use vinyl, CD, laptops and FX units in his armoury. His dirty, pumping sets infused with uplifting melodic breakdowns and unrelenting grooves always get the dancefloor wiggling and stomping, and there are always a few unheard gems in his record box.

In his career Si has been talented enough to grace the decks at big clubs across London such as Brixton Academy, Egg Club and Ministry of Sound, and play for numerous promotions such as Frantic, Antiworld, Trigger Funk, Fused, Poison, Recreation and Slackers Convention to name a few. Si has had many residencies at smaller clubs and bars too including Chapel Bar, Rhythm Factory, Artesian Well, Inigo and Southside Bar.

He has been producing dance music for a number of years, and specialises in remixing dance versions of tracks for bands. In February 2009 Papa Si released his debut album ‘Smile in the Face of the Enemy’, giving all the profits to charity.",False,62,93,17,0,29,6

Uri Mood began his career in the late 90s as DJ playing in the best clubs of Barcelona's city, making people dance with a very personal mix of house, tech and afro sounds, to later, begin his career as music producer.

His productions are defined by himself as a sound strongly influenced by House music, but that not only intends to make people dance, it also tries to make his audience understand that electronic music should have a message beyond rhythm, as it happened in the very beginning.

He's got his own radio show called 'City Drums Radio Show' and his music has been supported by artists such as Roger Sánchez, Juliet Sikora, Todd Terry, David Penn, Camelphat, Jess Bays, Sam Divine, among many other artists.

From percussions to pianos, from gospel to Afro-American ethnic music, vocals full of freshness and message, synthesizers and electronic sounds, rhythmic and bass sounds with a unique and unmistakable groove and energy.

All these nuances make Uri Mood a very personal and unique artist with carefully crafted technique and musical quality, both, on the dance floor and in his own creations.",False,3816,575,21,4,460,169

Runs Bad Haz Techno track promotion https://soundcloud.com/badhazrecords - badhazrecords@gmail.com

BACKGROUND
Hegstraction grew up in the 80s & 90s heavily influenced by the emergent electronic music in Amiga, Nintendo & PlayStation video games & also the movie soundtracks made by electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream & Kraftwerk. This led to a natural inclination towards house, techno & trance music. More recently he has been influenced by the German techno DJ/producers Felix Krocher & Stephan Bodzin.

INSPIRATION
His inspiration differs from most artists as it comes from the dance floor where he is most at home. Through over 20 years experiencing DJ sets worldwide in such places as London, Manchester, Leeds, Barcelona, Naples, Rome, Sicily, Prague, Berlin, Goa, Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, Hanoi, Sydney, San Francisco, Atlanta, Denver, Montreal & Buenos Aires, his ideas have been shaped.

METHODOLOGY 
He approaches each track as a mini set building up slowly using level changes, sounds that stimulate & energize whilst also bringing it back down ready for the next DJ or track creating a trance-like state. Sections of tracks are designed to be used for DJs to isolate interesting segments or sounds for mixing purposes. Skeletalism is used in some tracks using closely related sounds. Other tracks feature massification where sounds are layered over time.

ARTISTIC VISION
Hegstraction has just completed his first 3 part project, which consists of 3 albums: Space, Movement & Light.

Movement 
Movement features 12 minimal tracks with house & techno elements; it was released in June 2019. The focus for this album was on sound cohesion & appropriate use of contrasting elements whilst also concentrating on the sound aesthetic to be highly pleasing to the ear & literally giving the listener sounds they could ‘run their teeth along & bite!’ The album was made to tell a story and is best listened to as a whole from track 1 through 12. Tracks Electric Popcorn, Versailles, Doorstep & Destiny were featured on BBC Music Introducing.

Light
Light was released in 2020 as 12 techno singles one released each month, which was then re-released as an album in early 2021. The 12 singles make up an album that is techno with minimal and experimental elements. It is based on his time spent in Berlin during the summer of 2019 taking in the vibrant techno scene there, visiting such temples of techno as Berghain, about blank & Sisyphos combined with elements & ideas that he has long held & wanted to see in techno tracks.
 
Space
Space is the third and final album in the three year, three part project - Space, Movement & Light. The album depicts a journey from earth, through our solar system, its elements, out of our galaxy and on to the next, with a few dramatic events and encounters along the way. The soundscape features various driving kicks and beats to mimic hurtling through space at speed, combined with cold, hard, dark, metallic percussion and synths that conjure up the harshness of the environment, and re-imagine tales of sci-fi lore.

I love music since I was teenager. I remember how hard I worked to earn a little bit money to save and have a small home studio with one of my classmate during a high school for recording and mixing some tunes 🔥

After finishing school and go to University and Military service did not have much time to focus on what I love and since I moved to Sydney, life wants me to go back to the right path which is music for me and share my feeling with the beautiful people like you ❤

Stay tuned for monthly episodes💕🔥

Bought my first Kam belt drive record decks in 1998, and started DJ-ing shortly around Cork City and County as well as getting a slot on local stations Kiss FM, NRG FM, Klub FM and a few shows on the legendary Radio Friendly. Genres at the time- trance, house and hard-house. Also started using Acid Pro to make my own edits and mashups.

Having been retired from the DJ-ing game since 2006, Ableton Live filled the void as I started to learn to produce tracks.

Now...
In 2019, I picked up my first midi controller, a Pioneer SB3 with Serato Pro and started putting new set mixes on mixcloud.

Currently, I'm putting out bootlegs and mashups using Ableton as a kind of learning curve to making original tracks.

Short term goal - 2k+ followers on soundcloud.
Long term goal - get something signed to a label!

864,175637446,https://soundcloud.com/eliahicks,Elía Hicks,PE,Hicksrecords (ZH)/ Purism (IT),,"Elía Hicks, Peruvian Artist based in Switzerland.
In 1999, his love for music was born when he learned to play the guitar, quickly followed by the bass, Piano and the drums. Whilst growing up in a small town in Peru, he composed his first songs and founded two band. A Punk band by the name of B.c.s.t.o. and a progressive Rock band called PHI. Later on he began producing for some friends and local Rock bands in his hometown.
After moving to Zurich in 2012, he decided to live in Berlin for a while and fell deeply in love with Techno. Dancing weekend after weekend, as well as during the week, was still not enough to satisfy his new vice. He started djing in 2014 but it didn’t come close to what he wanted to achieve musically. So he bought his first Decks and started playing Vinyl during sleepless nights. 
The only way he could free his mind of the circulating ideas, melodies and bases in his head was to channel them, testing sounds and shapes with no expectation whatsoever, and finally felt like he was getting closer to his creative amition.
After a long process he now believes to have found his true sound and since then sleeps soundly.
Hicks records is the name of his Own Label founded in 2019 and he is currently part of the Purism Label family.

From groovy to deep, the ,Hicks’ style can be described as dry and definitely always Minimal/House.

He would watch the after movies for Qlimax and Defqon and be amazed by the feeling and energy that came from them, he wanted to make people happy just like that. 

With time he decided to take a go at producing his own music, his main objective? Make a sound with an energetic melodic force that had both drive and energy. Effectively bridging the gap between Rawstyle and Euphoric, making pure untamed Hardstyle. 

Growing now as a producer and a Dj, Aversion is bringing his energy and passion to crowds everywhere. With the goal to ignite the same spirit for Hardstyle into people, that inspired him to start making this music.

There is no denying that party’s and music go hand in hand and the top priority for Australia’s Bonka is just this - oh, with a few added bottles of Jager to ignite the situation! The duo made up of Lachlan and Connor is two flamingly excited DJ/producers who have been known to tear down walls in clubs & festivals upon the delivery of their slick main room and mashup wars on the frequent. Notably one of Australia’s most sought-after lords of mash-up, Bonka has it nailed with paragons like The Chainsmokers, Timmy Trumpet, Deorro, Tujamo, Tommy Trash, TJR and more sprinkling their sets with a well infused Bonka lead while also owning their explosive live shows across the country.


With a catalogue signed to Mixmash Records, Revealed Recordings, Ministry of Sound, TurnItUp and the like; Bonka haven’t taken the stale ol’ road through electronic music but have instead aggressively taken their sound right to where it needs to be - on dance floors and in the playlists of fellow electronic icons. While proudly boasting 3x Billboard Mix/Airplay Top 10's singles in the United States, their chart topping singles ‘Focus’ & 'Chase' both took out the top spot with a #1 placing in the ARIA Club Chart and saw their fair share of rotation across major Australian radio while 'Chase' also took out #1 in the U.S. Media Base Charts being the most played dance record on American radio. Hits like ‘R.A.G.E.’, ‘Switch It’, 'Overdrive' & 'Bang Boom' all saw international attention topping the prestigious Beatport charts at #1 consecutively. Blazing the full musical empire for their fans, Bonka also blast out a monthly show ‘Let’s Go Bonkas’ featuring their own recipes alongside guest spots by A list DJ’s from around the globe which frequently takes out the #1 spot in the Australian iTunes Music Podcast Charts.


On the road with a fully loaded tour schedule, the aficionados set fire to venues across the globe and quite frankly very rarely see their own beds! From stages Australia wide to clubs and festivals across the globe it’s safe to say the Bonka party travels on no sleep, but the drinks best be on ice and the party at the ready.",True,45189,1444,60,4,5732,2131

1017,398575,https://soundcloud.com/andrewrayel,Andrew Rayel,,Chisinau,,"Trance producer and DJ from Republic of Moldova.

He’s the modern day Mozart, today’s leading talent in the ever-growing trance scene. He’s the pride of Moldova, known for his unique and very own sound. He is Andrei Rata, better known as Andrew Rayel. 

Born on July 21st, 1992, his young age never stopped him from taking the lead in the next generation of EDM producers. Developing strong musical skills, he studied orchestral music and kicked off his producing career at only 13 years of age. It didn’t take long for the passionate music lover to translate his ideas into sounds. He created a truly unique, significant sound, one of piano power, harmonic balance and euphoric tales. And so, years later, his originals and remixes are praised by many and loved by more. But, rest assured, the Andrew Rayel story has only just started. 

""Trance was the perfect solution as it is an combination of melody, harmony and energy, elements that I prefer the most.” says Andrew Rayel.

Often called ‘the new Armin van Buuren’, it’s no surprise that Andrew indeed found the support of the man himself. Having the number one DJ supporting his tracks on the world famous A State of Trance radio show has ever been a dream of Andrew. And sometimes, dreams come true. His tracks ‘550 Senta’, ‘How Do I Know’ ft. Jano, ‘Aeon of Revenge’, ‘Aether’, ‘Deflagration’, ‘Musa’ and ‘Zeus’ all made it to the show, often voted Tune of the Week and Future Favourite. The trance scene embraced Andrew’s refreshing sound, giving him a very warm welcome. 

His tracks found a solid home on the A State of Trance and Armind labels, both part of the Armada Music family. Impressed by his originals, it didn’t take long until the Rayel sound became hot property for remixes. And so, Andrew was lucky enough to handle remix duties for tracks by Armin van Buuren, Markus Schulz, Tiësto, W&W, Bobina, Tenishia and many more. Earning the support of the DJ elite, the Rayel sound has spread all across the globe, from the underground clubs to the mainstream festivals. 

Though his career is fairly young, Andrew has already DJ’ed the world’s most legendary clubs and massive festivals. From Kazantip, Global Gathering, Trancefusion, Ball En Blanc, Trancemission and Ministry of Sound to multiple A State of Trance 600 events, the A State of Trance Ibiza nights at Privilege and the world-famous Monday Bar cruise. As a result of his hard work and dedication, fans voted him #77 in the DJ Mag Top 100 of 2012 which paid off in 2013 by being voted as ""Highest Climber"" ranking him at #28. The ascent continued in 2014, as being ranked #24!

Same goes for the highly anticipated Andrew Rayel debut album. Set for release on Armada Music, trance land eagerly holds their breath, craving more of Andrew’s magic dancing dust. A little pre-taste of what’s to come, is Andrew’s very first and official compilation: ‘Mystery of Aether’. Out on Armada Music in early September 2013, it’s Rayel doing what he does best. He moves us. 

“I believe music is a universal language that unites people with nothing but love. I intend to make sure that my tracks are all about emotions and happiness. That’s what’s driving music, making the world a better place.” says Andrew Rayel. ",True,170375,50,321,69,52,9

Eric Seall –better known by his stage name Ace Aura– is an American bass music producer and DJ, best known for pioneering the melodic/future riddim brand of dubstep. His unique style has garnered support from the likes of Zomboy, NGHTMRE & SLANDER, Steve Aoki, Zeds Dead, Laidback Luke, Ookay, 12th Planet, Flux Pavilion, Borgore, William Black and many more.

Seall grew up in a Protestant household in McKinney, TX and grew to be a passionate Christian at a young age. He began producing faith-influenced EDM songs under the name “Ace Aura” in 2012 and has unashamedly continued down that same path ever since.

Ace Aura’s 2020 was highlighted by the release of two different concept EPs (Comatose and reset_environment), as well as “Rise,” “Waiting,” “Sum Buddy” with Dr. Ozi, and the surprise hits “Noddin’” with Millennial Trash and “Self-Love” with Trinergy.

2021 was undoubtedly Ace Aura’s biggest year yet, kicking off with his debut Monstercat release “Stay” with TYNAN. He continued to make even bigger leaps during the coming months, releasing “The Feeling” with Crankdat, his first remix package (Comatose: Awakening), and his first sample pack, Melodic Riddim Vol. 1 with Chime (which hit #1 on the Splice charts and remained there for four consecutive weeks).

2021 also saw the release of “Resist” with Subtronics (called an “anthemic record” by Forbes), which helped Ace Aura earn a direct support slot for Subtronics’ sold out Cyclops Rocks show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre.",True,22014,1052,60,54,4216,2531

Having first raised the attention of promoters in Belfast, Northern Ireland with his weekly streams on Facebook, his grasp of social media has enabled the young upstart to cultivate an organic fanbase of thousands from the comfort of his own studio. Joining the dots between techno, trance and hardstyle whilst still having a respect and understanding of the classics, you can almost forget you are listening to an artist barely in his teenage years.

An award-winning, multi-platinum selling recording artist, Timmy has forged his way into the epicenter of influential artists taking the world by storm. His breakthrough release Freaks reigned in over 100 million plays on Spotify, reached five times platinum status in Australia, dominated the charts in ten countries, and became the highest selling track of all time on Ministry of Sound Australia.         

His music career boats of an extensive resume spanning over twenty years from early beginnings as a classically trained Jazz musician. At the age of thirteen Timmy was named 'Young Musician of the Year' before being granted a full scholarship to the Conservatorium of Music, where Sydney Symphony Orchestra's Anthony Heinrich tutored him. Within two years he secured a position as the leading solo trumpet player in the Australian All-Star Stage Band, taking part in an extensive European tour covering some of the world's biggest Jazz Festivals. 

As a songwriter and producer, Timmy has dominated the club charts including the Beatport number one hits The Buzz, Psy Or Die and Party Til We Die on Spinnin’ Records. Following the consistent success of his collaborations and solo releases, an impressive international touring schedule of over two hundred shows per year has launched Timmy center stage. Whether it’s selling out back-to-back solo shows in Rome or playing iconic events like Tomorrowland, the mighty trumpet is winning and wowing audiences over time and time again. 

Refusing to be pigeonholed within a single genre, his music is supported by an expansive array of artists from Armin Van Buuren to Steve Aoki and can be heard in A-list sets main stage at EDC and Ultra Music Festival. In his home country of Australia he has hosted national TV and radio shows for renowned networks like MTV, and has been voted the number one DJ at the ITM Awards. 2017 promises to be the most exciting year to come with huge releases on the horizon supported by extensive world tours.

High demand for his services on every hard trance label worth mentioning and picking up massive support from all the major players from UK to Australia, Europe to USA proved that a new hard trance star was born in 2015.  Coming from a trance background when hard trance was a HUGE part of the trance scene, Thomas felt a strong urge to crossover over into the bigger scene and the support of names such as Paul Van Dyk, Aly & Fila, Indecent Noise, Mark Sherry, MaRLo and even the godfather of Hard Trance Scot Project showed him this was more than possible!  With releases on many pedigree trance imprints including FSOE, Bonzai, Afterdark, Mental Asylum, Outburst, Damaged, his own Hard Trance Revolution imprint plus various compilation cds including Skullduggery and Afterdark, Thomas continues to pioneer and push his Tech and Hard Trance sound.

Music from the future.

EverLight is the synth addicted, button mashing decoction of Matt Seagrave’s 17 years obsession with trance music and the technology that makes it. 

Through sheer dedication to musicianship since barely a teenager, Matt has covered a massive range of electronic music. Sharpening down to his razor edged signature EverLight sound; relentless underground trance, uncompromising in character.

With a thirst for innovation and a fearless streak, EverLight is not afraid to push the boundaries. Cultivating cutting edge sounds, creative concepts, and unique live performances with huge amounts of soul.

As pioneer of the BlackNet imprint, Matt showcases multiple disciplines across music, graphic design, videography, and more, collaborating with those keen to push the creative envelope in trance and establishing a de-facto creative hub.

Signings on BlackNet, as well as respected record labels including Future Sound Of Egypt’s Clandestine imprint, Outburst Records and Pure Trance, have been featured on globally known compilations and radio shows including A State Of Trance, Pure Trance, VII, Grotesque, Outburst and more. 

Meanwhile strong and steady support from the best forward thinking DJ’s in the scene such as John Askew, Alex Di Stefano, Simon Patterson, Sean Tyas, Will Atkinson, Mark Sherry, Greg Downey, and Armin Van Buuren ensure that his futuristic sound is constantly recognisable in clubs and festivals all over the world. 

To siphon EverLight's music production passion onto the dancefloor, Matt performs with a custom built live performance system tailored exactly to his workflow. 

This system allows him the freedom to chop, change, remix, and mash up his music library on stage across 8 virtual “decks”. The result is a DJ set with more flexibility and creativity, honing in on exactly what the crowd wants, when they want it.

Or if a more dramatic streak is needed, EverLight will take to his “LiveWire” performance system. Where direct control of 16 instruments allow him to flex his live performance skills to produce one ever-evolving arrangement, responding directly to the ebb and flow of the crowd while staying ahead of the curve. 

Meanwhile, 253 full colour LEDs housed inside of an iconic custom built mask, flash, strobe, and pulse in time with the music, controlled by EverLight while he plays, adding an immense amount of character to his performances and leaving a lasting impression on the crowd.

EverLight’s live prowess has been subject to praise across the scene, including that of AA Meeting, whom he helped to build their live performance system.

EverLight is quickly rising up the ranks of the European trance circuit with passion fueled performances at globally recognisable events, such as The Gallery @ The Ministry Of Sound (UK), Luminosity Beach Festival (NL), Horizons Festival (Ireland), Trancecoda and Trance Sanctuary (UK). A residency at Anomaly in his home city of Birmingham has gathered him a cult following and built a platform for EverLight to test his latest auditory experiments.

Put simply, EverLight is one of the brightest upcoming talents in trance.",False,2540,136,110,11,115,172

Now, he is interested in applying this knowledge to music, such as studying the physics of acoustic and electronic musical instruments to create sounds with greater expressiveness or the relationship between emotions and music.

He also has inclinations to expand this knowledge to EDM parties, like using optics for visual effects, psychology for a safer environment, or even ecology to work for a balanced environment between the venue and what surrounds it.

In terms of music styles, his tastes include a large part of electronic music styles, from the most commercial, such as Big Room or Dance, to the most underground, including Industrial, Ambient or Experimental. But he is focused especially in the energetic ones, like Trance, Hard House, Hardstyle, Goa Trance or Full On Psy Trance. He also shows a growing interest in styles outside electronics, such as world music (folk), cinematic music, pop or swing. His idea is to learn from them and incorporate their characteristics both in production and in dj sessions.

In short, his interest consists in analyzing what surrounds the EDM culture to enrich it, contributing ideas, learning from people who have experience and, ultimately, working for the benefit, not only of those with whom he is going to work or his own, but also of the rest of the community.

También tiene inclinaciones en expandir estos conocimientos a las fiestas EDM, como por ejemplo, empleando la óptica para los efectos visuales, la psicología para la seguridad, o, incluso, la ecología para trabajar por un entorno equilibrado entre el recinto y lo que lo rodea.

En cuanto a estilos de música, sus gustos incluyen gran parte de los estilos de música electrónica, desde las más comerciales, como el Big Room o el Dance, hasta lo más underground, incluyendo el Industrial, Ambient y Experimental. Pero está centrado especialmente en las enérgicas, como el Trance, Hard House, Hardstyle, Goa Trance y Full On Psy Trance. También muestra un interés creciente en estilos fuera de la electrónica, tales como las músicas del mundo (folclóricas), música cinemática, pop y swing. Su idea consiste en aprender de ellos e incorporar sus características tanto en la producción como en las sesiones de dj.

2018 will without a doubt be the year of SaberZ, working on upcoming solos and collaborations with major artists, set to be featured on massive record labels. This year does not just hold massive releases, but also the first world tour where we hope to meet a lot of our beloved fans at the shows.
After the success of “Journey” back in July, SaberZ returns to Revealed Recordings with new 
offering “Epidemic”, once again showcasing why the Hungarian duo are two of the most in-
demand producers of 2018. ‘Epidemic’ has been a mainstay across the world in label boss 
Hardwell’s recent sets, with standout plays at both weekends of Tomorrowland and at Ultra 
Europe. 
The track starts with an ominous vibe, which sets the dark tone for the rest of the track, laced with percussive synth stabs, electronic flutters and a pounding hardstyle kick, which works in tandem with the growling, low bassline that pushes the track forward. The theme is switched on its head in the main breakdown, as a melancholic piano melody is introduced that quickly develops into a soaring big room synth lead that continues into the drop. 
SaberZ have accrued huge support over recent releases, with heavyweight names such as 
Hardwell, Blasterjaxx and W&W all taking notice of the young duo’s impressive production 
talent, and with ‘Epidemic’ that list is set to continue to increase.  

Be sure to look out for SaberZ at the nearest festival or club next to you, because they can be tuning in anytime. #ZTEAM

In 2016, Isiah was invited to perform at Yangon’s “THE ONE” entertainment park to a crowd of 17,000 people, which was his first show under the Lit Lords moniker.

Date: The future unknown

Beneath an endless grey sky, there lies a global alliance that defies the new world order. In a society where free-thinking, identity, and culture have been removed, these rebels prove themselves to be the antithesis.

Among the chaos of the world, harmonies of the future unknown ring through the resistance, serving as a reminder of what it’s like to feel human. It lights a fire in the souls of those who persevere against the elitist regime. And that fire is rising.

This is our future.

We are NURAVE.

Ian lit 2009 on fire with  performances at Hardcore Till I Die in the Sun, in Lloret De Mar, Spain  and several of his tracks peaking in the top 10 on trackitdown.net’s hardcore charts, more than one of which have been dropped by BBC Radio 1′s award winning DJ, Kutski.

1234,3438235,https://soundcloud.com/pendulum,pendulum,Pendulum,London,GB,"Formed during 2002 by three musicians from Western Australia with similar visions and musical backgrounds, Pendulum’s mission has always been to pull together their production resources, ideas and influences from various styles of music, to create a new sound that they felt was missing from dance music. The individual members behind Pendulum had been active in Perth’s live music scene for several years: producer / vocalist / keyboardist Rob Swire and producer / bassist Gareth McGrillen played together in the acclaimed Perth band Xygen, while Paul ‘El Hornet’ Harding was a veteran of the Perth DJ scene.

The initial result of the collaboration between the three was the seminal 'Vault', released on the highly respected 31 Records. 'Vault' went on to become one of the biggest anthems of 2003. This was confirmed when the track received the much sought after Knowledge Magazine award for 'Best Single of 2003'. ‘Vault’ was followed by a series of brilliant tracks including 'Trail of Sevens', 'Spiral' and 'Ulterior Motive', 'Back to You' and 'Still Grey' and a remix of 'Tonite' by Concord Dawn. Two heavyweight DJs that have supported the Pendulum sound ever since its creation were the legendary Adam F and the renowned DJ Fresh who asked Pendulum to join their recently formed Breakbeat Kaos label in order to form a tight crew of like minded musicians. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity; as a result towards the end of 2003 the trio relocated to the UK and have been touring the world extensively ever since in an attempt to generate further awareness around their unique sound. Pendulum’s debut single for Breakbeat Kaos, the epic 'Another Planet' backed with 'Voyager' exceeded any prior expectations. The single made its debut at #1 in the UK’s National Dance Chart and even went Top 40 in the mainstream chart.
2005 saw Pendulum release their debut artist album on Breakbeat Kaos, the highly acclaimed ‘Hold Your Colour’ that has gone on to sell in excess of 300,000 copies and spawned their first Top 30 hit in the shape of the single ‘Slam / Out Here’. The band’s full live experience (which adds guitarist Peredur ap Gwynedd, drummer Kodish and MC Verse to the core trio) also became an exciting prospect with a defining headline performance at Glastonbury’s Dance Stage being a particular highlight. By now the biggest artist on the underground, Pendulum aimed to continue their rise by signing a new deal with Warner Bros. Records / Ear Storm.

Re-emerging with the fan favourite single ‘Granite’, it was the Radio 1 A-listed follow-up ‘Propane Nightmares’ that enabled Pendulum to leap into the mainstream. The band then followed a defining performance at Radio 1’s Big Weekend by seeing their second album ‘In Silico’ debut at #2 in the UK album charts. The album was certified Gold within a month of release and its success continued unabated over the summer months with a diverse array of festival appearances including Linkin Park and Jay-Z’s Projekt Revolution, Download, Creamfields, Reading / Leeds and T in the Park. Following a succession of sold-out London shows and a memorable performance on Later with Jools Holland, Pendulum’s momentum continued with their biggest UK headlining tour to date before an audience in excess of 50,000 people. Radio 1’s continuing support also included a special documentary on the band that aired over the Christmas period, while ‘In Silico’ approaches 300,000 sales in the UK alone.
Pendulum have also been making huge strides towards breaking through in America having earned praise from the likes of Billboard (who described the band as a “breakneck brand of aural dynamite”) and the LA Times (“The electro-rock band evokes the Prodigy's sense of screaming, face-crushing bombast with savvy beats straight off the contemporary low-end-heavy zeitgeist”). Their debut US live tour featured thirteen sold-out shows from coast to coast, including a date at Los Angeles’ 1300 capacity Mayan Theater. Their tour also trekked into Brazil and Mexico. Their North American progress forged ahead with frenetic television appearances on Jimmy Kimmel and Carson Daly. Meanwhile, their continuing live popularity also received a succession of boosts with killer sets at Coachella and SXSW and their first ever headline appearance at Miami’s Ultra Music Festival.

One of the most visceral and exhilarating live experiences around (“One of the most enthusiastic reactions afforded a main stage act in Big Day Out history,” observed Kerrang! “Phenomenal doesn’t even come close”), Pendulum’s highly acclaimed live performance has been captured in their ‘Live At Brixton’ CD / DVD set. Grammy nominated director Paul Caslin has created an awe-inspiring visual celebration of the band’s live experience that captures the fiery intensity of the audience’s impassioned reaction with a dazzling visual artistry never before seen in a live document. Early 2010 saw a change to the LIVE Pendulum set up with the addition of Seattle born drummer KJ Sawka.

After some time spent writing their third studio album, Pendulum returned with 'Immersion' released in May 2010, which shot straight to No.1 in the UK Album Charts. The band followed this success with 2 Sold Out UK Tours, 2 huge shows at London's Wembley Arena, tours in Europe and Australia and a massive summer spent smashing the international festival circuit. At the beginning of 2011 the band headed to North America where they played as special guests on Linkin Park's 'A Thousand Suns US Arena Tour' followed by a run of their own headline tour dates across North America. They then returned home to Australia to headline the Future Music Festival, before heading into another summer of headline slots at festivals all over the UK and Europe, including the penultimate slot on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury Festival, and headlining slots at Download Festival, T In The Park, V Festival and Bestival.

Don’t sleep on Sikdope; he’ll make sure it costs you. The young Polish beatsmith has built a reputation as a chameleon in the studio — from vicious bass-house to radio-ready progressive cuts and futuristic trap sensibilities — with an uncanny knack for keeping everyone guessing. Sikdope’s brand of merciless festival ammunition would go on to catch the ears, and co-sign, of Calvin Harris on his breakout hit, “Snakes,” essentially lighting a fuse that just continues to burn. Now the tenacious young producer has one hand firmly gripping the wheel and a lead foot flooring the gas, steering the direction of electronic music’s most exciting new sounds. When he’s not relentlessly canvasing club and festival circuits across the world, the “My House” producer is usually buried under headphones in the lab, tampering with dangerous new club-primed sonics, building an endless catalog of blistering original works and head-splitting remixes. With a decade of classic musical training at one of Europe’s top production schools fueling his creative process, Sikdope constantly has an arsenal of new projects ready to be loaded into the chamber at a moment’s notice. Simultaneously pressing his brand of punishing trap products to innovative new limits and helping pioneer a colossal bass-house swell, Sikdope is an ever-increasingly menacing force, both behind the console and the decks. A growing legion of fans all over the world, from Los Angeles to Sydney with a massive movement forming in Asia, know one thing is certain, “music is the cure,” and Sikdope consistently proves to have the remedy. Having dominated festivals across four continents —from Belgium’s Tomorrowland to EDC Orlando’s Main Stage — with releases on Spinnin, Fly Eye, and now Tiësto’s legendary Musical Freedom powerhouse, Sikdope is positioned as one of today’s most explosive talents, and he’s dead set on taking over the game.",True,191773,2,71,19,174,379

Remember that little kid from Indiana Jones? Google ""ShortRound"" and you will find a little asian kid hanging out with Harrison Ford and also some images of one of the hottest new talents in the Melbourne underground scene.

Five years ago Vincent Fir aka ShortRound found an underground scene that he instantly fell in love with and had been a part of ever since. 
Being inspired by the sounds of Orkestrated and Kalus, ShortRound spent endless hours perfecting his skills on the decks and when it was time to make the jump from bedroom to the clubs he made an instant impact on the Melbourne underground scene.
Playing at only the most respected underground clubs all over Melbourne, in the space of 6 months short round had gone from a side room dj to one of the most in demand DJ's in the minimal scene.
Short rounds mix tapes are absolute fire! Delivering regular mix tapes to his 11k followers on sound cloud  generating over 100,000 plays in a matter of weeks.

Talking influences from the  Melboune minimal scene and an ever growing psy-trance scene - ShortRound's sets create a diverse mixture of all his influences and pushing boundries and forgetting constraints of what people expect.

Short round has recently stepped up his love for the scene and started collaborating with some of Melbourne's heavyweights and will soon be releasing original tracks and remixes for some very large record labels.",True,57244,1490,83,0,1459,1417

1278,203644,https://soundcloud.com/tomfall,TomFall,Tomi Fallenius,Lohja,FI,"EDM aficionados often posses an insatiable desire for new talent that can deliver a refreshing twist to their ears. For Tom Fall, the challenge seems to come naturally. A native of Lohja, Finland, the 27-year-old producer began his journey into the realm of music at age 10. Like every ambitious child with a musical passion, Fall began to experiment with a variety of instruments, but most commonly found himself learning to play his brother’s guitar by ear. It wasn’t long until those ears became mesmerized by the sounds that one can only find within the elusive world of electronic dance music.

As his love for trance, progressive, and house increased, the 16-year-old set his sights onto the complex, fascinating world of music production. The self-taught talent began his production endeavors with the legendary Modplug Tracker, and continuously challenged himself further, ultimately with Cubase. After a few years performing live DJ shows, and fine tuning his production skills, the budding talent saw his first and only demo, “Cubic,” released as a single on Anjunadeep in 2010. After releasing a handful of tracks, including his own Sirius XM BPM radio hit single, “Untouchable feat. Jwayden,” Tom Fall has become one of EDM’s most highly-requested remixers and producers in just a few short months. Fall has reworked tunes for a multitude of high profile artists, including Armin van Buuren, Cosmic Gate, W&W, and Morgan Page. His latest original single, “iROK,” released over the summer and became a colossal success, peaking at #22 on the Beatport Progressive House Top 100 chart. It flooded airwaves across the globe and top DJ radio shows for months, and received support by several of the industry’s top DJs, including Hardwell, Knife Party, tyDi, and Tritonal. 

The constantly-evolving-producer recently received a coveted spot on Armin van Buuren’s “A State of Trance 550” event at Ministry of Sound in London. His set showcased his ability to seamlessly mesh a variety of EDM subgenres into what became one of the most widely welcomed sets of the night.  After releasing a wide array of remixes in such a short amount of time, the self-proclaimed studio rat will soon begin working on his debut album, slated for release on Armada Music. Fans can expect the album to encapsulate the different sonic elements that make an original Tom Fall record unique, infectious, and memorable.

1281,13577,https://soundcloud.com/corderoy,Corderoy,Dale Corderoy,London,GB,"Corderoy is undoubtedly one of the most exciting exponents of the future electronic scene. His productions have been described as fresh and innovative by some of the leading players in electronic music and his records have been consistently backed by the big names that count. Combining elements of House, Trance, Progressive and leftfield Electronica, as well throwing in some rock influences, Dale is now starting to mix it with the big boys.

After and string of high quality releases on imprints like Napith, High Contrast, Vandit and Perfecto, Dale has launched his own imprint - CDRY.

“There are no genre restraints which allows me to be creative and experimental. I’m not jumping on bandwagons or staying within one tight niche with this label”.

Being open minded and extremely versatile is very definitely his modus operandi. Always keen to show he’s not scared of fusing big melodies and great vocals, Dale is constantly looking to deliver fresh sounding material that works on dance floors and as well as through headphones.

His recent production, for Perfecto Records, the highly flammable ‘Kerosene’ is another mould breaker. Co-written with members of seminal rock-trance act ‘Dogzilla’ and indie band ‘Belasco’. Corderoy takes guitars and vocals and mashes them within an inch of their lives to create this totally original sounding hybrid club anthem. Paul Oakenfold, the label’s owner, loved the track so much he just asked Corderoy to remix one of his classics ‘Ready Steady Go’.

As Dale stamps his unique mark in dance music this year risks will be taken, boundaries battered down and ultimately his music will filter into the ears of the masses.

1282,200263,https://soundcloud.com/alexmorph,Alex M.O.R.P.H.,,,DE,"It takes a strong heart and inventive mind to live on the very top of the electronic dance scene – especially if your career spans nearly two decades. Luckily, German producer and DJ Alex M.O.R.P.H. holds both of these, along with a lively spirit that seems to feed on music. His ways with melody are widely known and loved, the M.O.R.P.H. sound a phenomenon that grabs the audience time and again, and the constant drive to reinvent himself is a mere reflection of his ability to stay ahead of the game. Backed up by a long list of highlights, yet ever looking out for the future, Alex M.O.R.P.H. is one of the rare characters to add color to the scene. And he’s not nearly done bringing the world his musical portrait. 

The M.O.R.P.H. Sound
Through each of the Alex M.O.R.P.H. originals, he tells a story. In a unique blend of energy, emotion and power, he connects music with feeling. And it is felt. With over 60 originals on his discography, including the mass-movers of ‘An Angel’s Love’, ‘Sunset Boulevard’, A State of Trance 2014 Tune of the Year runner-up ‘The Reason’, ‘Eternal Flame’ and ‘Walk The Edge’, it’s clear that Alex is way past the rookie stage. Looking back on two successful artist albums, the 2009 ‘Purple Audio’ and 2013 ‘Prime Mover’ albums, the ‘Hands On Armada – Part 2’ remix compilation,  as well as collaborations with Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Rank1 and of course lifelong studio partner Woody van Eyden, it’s really the challenge in production itself that inspires Alex to push his boundaries. With a brand new artist album coming up in the summer of 2015, inspiration continues to thrive in the M.O.R.P.H. studio and fans barely need to bide their time to enjoy new originals.

Each of his remixes, whether for Dash Berlin, Armin van Buuren, Faithless, Ayumi Hamasaki, Aly & Fila, Within Temptation or any other of the more than 120 remixes he’s done, displays his ability to create a different angle to a track and give it that Alex M.O.R.P.H. spin. A spin that is not only loved, appraised and welcomed by the industry’s key players, but also continuously surprises fans of the charismatic producer. His remixes are known to capture the imagination, as melody combines melancholy and banging beats melt together with warmth, creating an endless dance of elements. 

The M.O.R.P.H. Experience
In his ongoing upward trajectory, Alex has seen a staggering amount of packed clubs, main stage decks and extraordinary events – featuring no one less than the man himself. From the legendary Trance Energy and A State of Trance events to Cream Ibiza, Mayday, Nature One, Soundtropolis, Stadium of Sound, Electronic Family and Ultra Music Festival, the list goes on and on. Legendary clubs and venues like Godskitchen, Monday Bar, Ushuaia Ibiza, Mandarine, Space Miami and most definitely the massive Madison Square Garden in New York, have witnessed some of Alex M.O.R.P.H.’s personal favorite sets and highlight moments in his career. 

After more than 11 years as the co-founder of the treasured HeavensGate events – with clubnights and festival events happening everywhere from Ibiza and Germany to Malaysia, South Korea and UK - and 450 episodes as the co-host of the critically acclaimed HeavensGate radio show, 2015 has a new concept in store for Alex. In April 2015, he kicked off his spanking new Universal Nation show and podcast, a weekly gathering to unite his fans as one and showcase exclusives, talents and must-hear tracks. Universal Nation marks another challenge in Alex’ comprehensive career as a fully-fledged artist, and lets listeners from all over the world experience what the man and his music are all about.",True,33558,3,562,43,87,47

Having been educated in music from a very early age, Franz has accelerated in composition and music production, and in doing so has fed his enormous passion and love for music.

Instantly drawn to the sound of electronic trance & progressive around the nineties, Franz began to learn the craft of mixing tracks, using turntables which enabled him to perform at various local club events. When he turned 18, he bought a synthesizer and turntables. Soon after, he started building a professional studio to engineer and record his very own productions.

Just 2 Years down the line, 'Fast Distance' became a name to be reckoned with. In 2007, the catchy Fast Distance strings and big rolling beats were grabbing the attention of a variety of Trance labels, including, Armada, Vandit, Enhanced Music and Flashover to name a few, not forgetting that his unique production ability was constantly gaining support from the biggest DJ's in the world, including Armin van Buuren, W&W, Paul van Dyk, Tiësto, Above & Beyond, Aly & Fila and Ferry Corsten.",False,1633,35,36,5,8,2

RayRay is Taiwan’s finest (and loudest) musical export and is dropping pins across the global electronic music map. The bass music extraordinaire is always close to the most enviable sonic spots and playing gigs at premier festivals like Glastonbury, ADE, Tomorrowland and Sonar. RayRay took to the sonic realm from very early on, where a true love story with sculpting beats unfurled when she was just 17. Initially on the hip-hop tip, she organically gravitated to the electronic music cartel, making her a diverse addition to the ever-evolving music industry. Today RayRay is an artist always in flux and is anything but generic—she has fueled a fierce open format style that is an intricately textured amalgamation of hip hop, EDM, Miami bass, tech house, trap and drumstep. 

What really turned up the volume however was a justified win at the Red Bull Thre3style competition and a couple of studio sessions with artists like Skrillex, Yellow Claw, and Atmozfears, and then the next chapter in her musical story was ablaze. Her reputation for injecting a savage signature sound into all her releases soon floated past the ears of Yellow Claw who quickly signed her to Barong Family where she released two EPs: 'Purple Alien' and 'Alien Invasion'. RayRay’s new home on the Dutch imprint has got her name on feverish demand and today she’s touring her propulsive sound all over the globe, creating seismic experiences for her newfound fans. Later this year, you can look forward to music from RayRay on Spinnin’ Records and Protocol Recordings, with releases on Tiësto’s label Musical Freedom to follow. For anyone looking at Asia, RayRay has literally become the one to watch.
The collective did not just immerse into her music talents, they even interested themselves to themethod of her madness, inviting her to present and speak her ideas of music and life for TEDx Talks and also Google Talks. The mad creativity runs deep to the soul of our artist, creating her other musical alter ego, producer, WiFi Grapes.

Her produced tracks have been used in several films. Be on the lookout for RayRay, the music she brings is the next generation of creative.

It was in a rave one night watching Dj Gammer one of my inspirations mixing that it occured to me that i wanted to be that side of the stage. So thats what i did and Dj Danii was born.
I started learning how to do basic beat matching/mixing on a friends pair of technics in 2011 determined to be able to play at my 21st birthday on April 2012. I did just that and then invested in my own set up as i knew i wanted to progress.
My first official booking was Interdance at the plug in birmingham 2012 it was an amazing first experience which led me to play and events such as Critical Mass, Core Unity, Northern Underground, Core Bilmey, Ravers Reunited, DNA, Mindblown, Raver Queen, Powercore, Revolution, Ravers Ibiza Pre Party and a few more.
I have also won a few competitions on my journey like, Ravers Got Talent, NTWICH, Delerious Future Talent, Battle Core Series to name a few.....Then in 2017 i had to take a break from the music due to family commitments. During this time one of my decks had broken.

March 2020 happend i got a new deck, i had a new alias and was ready to make a come back. I started streaming once a week every week on my profile to slowly build up following, as it slowly started to grow i then reactivated my artist page and began the push on that. 
At this point the country went into a lockdown meaning more life streams, which really i have to helped give me the platform i needed to be noticed. So i just watched a few fellow streamers and Dj C is and always has been a huge inspiration of mine and he just helped inspre what i wanted to give and show.
The burning energy and passion i have for this music has given me a drive to want to share it with everyone else around the world. So to get the momentum going i have remaind consistent on my artist page, been made resident for the best online radio stream Rave Anywhere, Designed my own website, created my own merch, i even have usbs that go out each month to those who want them. Its crazy how far i have come in such a small amount of time and i have to thank each and every person who feels what i feel.",False,2413,450,15,0,231,349

Supported by Tiësto, Jax Jones, Martin Garrix, YVES V, AfroJack, Dannic, Blasterjaxx & More!

Having met at an early age, best mates Jack and Jake came together through friendship and their love of dance music to form NuKey. 

After being relatively quiet so far in their 2-year journey, DJ & Producer duo NuKey from Leicester, UK, have created quite a storm as 2020 is drawing to a close. They won the Be Yourself Music Remix Competition for the track 'The Way I Am - Max Vermeulen'. This remix will serve as their first official remix - and what an exciting label to debut their first remix on! 

Shortly after that, the pair were finalists in the Spinnin' Records World's Biggest Demo Drop competition, of which they were WINNERS! Hand selected by Tiesto himself as his favourite track of the competition. Antidote was the winning contender which earned the lads a well deserved release on Musical Freedom! Not only that, but they picked up some huge supports along the way from the likes of Tiesto, Jax Jones, AfroJack, R3HAB, CID and YVES V!! Their victory also means they're supported by the biggest DJ in the world, Tiësto!

NuKey are now waiting to see what's instore for them on the back of what has been such a successful year, and cannot wait to hit the ground running in 2021!

It’s been amazing twenty years since me and my friends started organizing illegal raves in the squat houses of Helsinki in early 90s. Most bizarre experience must have been DJing for Jean-Paul Gaultier and Helena Christensen at a Berlin fetish club Kit Kat after their first ever Berlin show. Most flashy ones have been entertaining the rich & famous of Hong Kong or Russia while warming up Chemical Brothers, Paul van Dyk or Underworld was something I’ll never forget. From the venues I’ve DJed Tresor in Berlin, Pacha in Ibiza, Ministry of Sound in London and CODE in Tokyo were special places to play.

My recording career started in 1998 with Slusnik Luna’s Nicklas Renqvist. ‘Unity‘ was signed to british Steelfish label and found it’s way to Gatecrasher and Renaissance compilations. Sasha and Oakenfold opened their Essential Mixes with it and Pete Tong played it on BBC Radio 1. Gigs with DJ Tiesto lead into signing to his Black Hole label while other releases include ‘Embrace’ on Five AM and ‘Beautiful‘ on Sential (finnish national singles chart #1). Most famous colaborations include ‘YearZero‘ together with Andy Moor, ‘God’s Garden‘ together with David West and ‘Zeitgeist‘ with Solarstone. My remixes include Aalto’s ‘Rush‘ made together with Super8, Stage One remix made for Hooj Choons, Way Out West’s ‘Killa‘ and more recently a bootleg remix of Hans Zimmer’s ‘Time‘ from Inception soundtrack which Paul Oakenfold loved so much he did his own edit. In 2011 I released my third artist album “20” which also celebrates my twenty years of DJing.

As promoters we have come a very long way from the days of illegal warehouse raves. Together with my friends, we have run Club Unity for over ten years, promoted Renaissance’s events in Helsinki and organized events called “Pacifique” for almost 3000 people in a water park. We have had fun at 16 hour Sunday clubbing sessions at DTM and have brought Jose Padilla to Finland. We have organised events on boats, in parks, on ice-skating rinks and even did one of Finland’s first flash mobs: the infamous One Minute Raves. The longest set I’ve ever played was 23 hours on New Year’s Day in 2010. To me electronic music and club culture has always been about open-mindness, unity amongst people and pushing the musical boundaries forward, whether it’s ambient concert in a park or full on rave in warehouse. Uniting the sounds, the minds, the people…",True,27554,294,250,28,81,759

It's 3am in a dimly lit nightclub, with the dancefloor locked into the tight groove.
The drone of the bassline reverberates through the floor, the walls, recoiling within the confines of your chest.
A vivid atmosphere that draws you in, takes you under, won't let go.
You're looking for an increasingly sinister sound, darker, with a hard edge.
A constant struggle, juxtaposing macabre unforgiving textures with the contrast of uplifting, melodic harmonies.
Peppered with percussive grooves and relentless, gritty sub frequencies to inscribe upon your soul.
The culmination presents itself in a distinct, unique and utterly shrill war cry.

Dennis Sheperd has thrust himself into the spotlight of the club scene in the past few years, offering prestigious music productions. The 25 year old DJ and Producer from Essen in Germany delights his fans and numerous, well-known artists worldwide, who support him and his music.

In 2007, Dennis established his name in the electronic music scene with ‘A Tribute to Life’, which received support by the best DJs such as Tiësto, Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk and Markus Schulz. This leap towards the forefront of the music scene was followed by his signing to the renowned record label Euphonic Records. Euphonic founders Kyau & Albert called him “Germany’s most promising newcomer in Progressive Trance”, which he proved with several hits in 2009. 

‘Black Sun’ became one of Dennis Sheperd’s most successful single releases. This was followed by ‘tyDi & Dennis Sheperd feat. Marcie – Somehow’ on Armada Music, his first cooperation with Australia’s most popular Trance DJ. Finally, only one month later, Dennis Sheperd and Cold Blue completed the hat-trick with ‘Freefalling’ on High Contrast. With these three releases, Dennis has built a large fan base and was regularly played in clubs and radios all around the globe.
His musical success was rewarded with numerous, international DJ performances on events, festivals and in clubs and with the award “The Best New Artist 2010” of his hometown Essen.

This award encouraged Dennis to push forward his artistic work. The production of his debut album was the next big step in his career. During 2010, he collaborated with well-known singers and songwriters. The result is an excellent album, which will be released on High Contrast, and which will cause a sensation among his fans and the electronic music scene in 2011 and 2012.

Before this will happen, Dennis has more aces up his sleeve, which will shorten the time to wait for the album. Among other things, Dennis made a mix for the upcoming remix album of Gareth Emery, who has already entitled Dennis in 2008 as “hot name to watch for the future”. Additionally, Dennis will perform on the legendary Mayday in Dortmund and show his skills as DJ once more. 

Dennis Sheperd presents himself as talented and outstanding artist, who fills his fans with enthusiasm and gets the support of the biggest DJs and numerous media channels of electronic music for each of his releases. 2011 will lift Dennis’ development as an artist to a new higher lever, not least because of his debut album.",True,10955,64,355,57,35,67

Firing up the bassbins and hitting you hard with a dose of raggamuffin junglist energy is what Ed Solo is all about. From Glastonbury to Canada's Shambhala, from dirty Brixton back rooms to Spanish arenas, Ed has travelled the globe throwing down his unique brand of ruffneck bassline bravado for more than a decade. 

Ed's knack for the rudest of hooks is equalled only by his sublime studio skills. He cut his teeth in the mid '90s engineering at the notorious SOUR Records studios, going on to lay down a series of groundbreaking collaborations with jungle kingpin DJ Brockie. In 2007 Ed released ‘Random Acts of Kindness’ alongside Skool of Thought, featuring ‘When I Was A Yout’ and ‘We Play The Music’ among others. A 10th anniversary remix package drops in 2017.

Ed’s partnership with Jungle Cakes partner in crime Deekline has thrown up some of the most memorable tunes of the decade. The pair recently mixed the chart-topping 5th edition of their Welcome to the Jungle series.",True,61271,1447,84,25,118,209

Jordi Calviño Pedreira a.k.a Loop Stepwalker, was born in A Coruña (Spain) in 1985. This young restless mind is one of the main Spanish Dubstep stalwarts; running the Culture Assault / Cultdub label, and also working on the creation of a new dubstep sound made with a blend of hardcore basslines, electrifying leads and stunningly brutal beats. Joining the ranks of the heavier end of the sound, to give as result some of the hardest vibes in Dubstep today.
An artist constantly involved in the scene, he continues to work on many projects with well known artists and has been sharing decks with DnB and Dubstep legends for quite some time now. His talent has been spread widely across Spain and Europe; playing at some of the most representative venues of the hard style, as well as big festivals. His experience, heavy tunes and skill behind the decks make Loop Stepwalker a sure shot for delivering dancefloor madness everytime he gets on the decks...
Supported and collaborating with people like Cooh/Balkansky, Broken Note, Culprate, Dean Rodell, Subshock, Sinister Souls, Niveau Zero, Vibromaster, Counterstrike, Dj Hidden and many many more...

--

Don’t assume you know everything about Halogenix through just one tune, one EP or one chapter of his career. Every release, collaboration, performance or project reveals a new string to the North London artist’s bow. A new fusion, a new feeling, maybe even a new alias. 

It’s been this way much longer than you might assume, too: Inspired by his father, a French horn player for the London Symphony Orchestra, for Laurence a focused, ambitious career in music was a dead cert. After negotiating classical theory and a variety of instruments and styles, he found his natural sonic habitat at 170BPM. A tempo that gave a wide enough canvas for him to explore, invent, subvert and never feel like he’s treading old ground. Signs of his respected stature were almost instantly evident as within months of releasing beats in 2011, he appeared on Noisia’s respected experimental imprint Invisible with ‘Askari’. 

Months later he became a founding member of a collective who gave 2012 its most definitive D&B track ‘Oblique’. The trio would eventually become known as the UK bass phenomenon Ivy Lab, an act who Laurence remained with until spring 2018. Between them their seismic signature ripped entirely new faultlines in the fertile 85/170 axis. They galvanized the halftime movement on an international level, giving us ageless tracks such as ’20 Questions’, ‘Baby Grey’ and ‘Thirsty’. During Laurence’s prolific tenure with the band they collaborated with Roses Gabor and SHADES (Alix Perez & EPROM), flipped hits by the likes of BANKS and Cam’ron, launched the critically saluted 20/20 LDN imprint, captured the essence of the influential movement with two innovative V/A compilations and helped to break the careers of the likes of Shield, Havelock and Balatron. 

During this time, the Halogenix name remained just as vital and incendiary. Key releases during this chapter include launching Critical Music’s innovation-championing Systems series which included his cross-scene supported barbed soul stepper ‘Her Waves’. There was also his Metalheadz debut EP ‘All Blue’, another body of work that mapped out Laurence’s stark palette of textural and emotional contrasts. It was followed by ‘Broken Man’ a 12” collaboration with drum & bass’s master architect Goldie himself.  

Then came two pivotal EPs in 2017: ‘Jump Suit’ dented dances via Alix Perez’s nonstop 1985 juggernaut and flexed from the startling soul of ‘The Night’ (with vocalist SOLAH) and the gritty, tunnelling technoid title track. Meanwhile ‘Velvet’ on Critical gave the world ‘Blej’, one of the biggest and most broadly supported D&B tracks of the year. Nominated for Best Production in the Drum&BassArena Awards in December 2017 ‘Blej’ ensured Laurence’s 2018 was even more remarkable as he showcased his full palette once again: His ‘Deep News’ EP and his role in The Upbeats high profile ‘No Sleep’ project further confirming Halogenix’s premiership status as one of drum & bass music’s most diverse, exciting and forward-facing producers and DJs. 

From collaborations with top tier kindred spirits such as Alix Perez, Noisia and Goldie to remixes of BANKS, The Glitch Mob Maverick Sabre, Wilkinson, SpectraSoul & dBridge, TC via production credits for Foreign Beggars and releases on Vision, Division, Shogun Audio, Ram Records, 3Beat and Universal; Laurence has continually explored, invented, subverted and forged new ground with new fusions, feelings and even an anonymous production alias he uses when penning beats for singers, songwriters and rappers. 

With more bow strings revealing with every release, collaboration and project, the next chapter of his career is his most exciting to date. No assumptions necessary.",True,30253,1,89,17,93,27

Involved in the ever-growing Los Angeles Techno scene, Emmanuel Andreas Santamarina is an artist that experiments with a multitudinous array of styles. With a knack for encompassing many trades of Techno, his rise in the Techno community is one no one can keep their eyes away from.

Emmanuel Santamarina grew up loving the stylizations of artists such as The Eagles, Pink Floyd, and America, eventually gravitating towards the newer sounds of Heavy and Progressive Metal., accompanied with a young love for The Gorillaz, Daft Punk, and Justice. However throughout his college years, he eventually gravitated towards  the sounds of Trance music, which lead to a love for Industrial, and then eventually, Techno. The sounds of Mord Records, Pole Group, and Perctrax eventually inspired him to start producing, and thus started his journey toward the Los Angeles Techno scene, one that has recently hit the ground running in the underground community.",False,1025,360,46,13,3559,267

One would be hard pressed to find another artist whose meteoric rise parallels that of Belgium’s most exciting new export, Amelie Lens. She has, in a little more than a year, soared from relative anonymity to one of todays most in-demand DJ/Producers the world over. Lens’ rise to the top may seem to have happened in the blink of an eye, but her work ethic, composure at the controls, crowd engagement and an incredible prowess in the studio have proven to be the perfect ingredients for her swift ascent to the apex of her trade. With her debut release on Italian imprint Lyase gaining a massive amount of attention, Amelie seized the moment and quickly delivered her first release on Pan-Pot’s highly lauded label Second State and followed shortly after with a stellar EP on one of the undergrounds most championed outfits ARTS. At the same time her releases started to flow consistently on high level labels, Amelie started her own event EXHALE at Labyrinth Club where she invites todays hottest acts as well as her “All Night Long” sets which prove she embodies an equal mastery to that of her peers with years more experience. With these critical foundations laid, it was no time before she began headlining the industries most acclaimed events. From Awakenings and Circoloco to today’s best clubs like DC-10 Lens commands an intense touring schedule trotting to all corners of the globe on a weekly basis. As if it wasn’t apparent after all this, Amelie is just getting going and there seems to be no decrease in her pursuit of world wide dance floor domination.",True,264037,6,41,11,136,83

Amsterdam’s catchy, sexy, filthy sound comes straight from the decks of Hot-Mama Wannabe A Star. Starting her career as a dancer she came down with the DJ virus in 1996 when she lost control on Miami’s Winter Music Conference. Soon she became the face of German Eurodance group ‘Nomansland‘ with hits ’7 seconds’ and ‘Fantasy’. A year later her DJ career was a fact.

Always different than most, Wannabe A Star collaborated with dancers she knew from the past. 1998 was the beginning of the famous dj duo Wannabe-a-Star & Miss B-have. When those two stepped behind the decks nobody could predict what was going to happen in the next few hours. At first the audience was puzzled and shocked. Was it a serious DJ set or an act strictly for the underground? Are they professional pole dancers or fashion-bitches from hell? The answer for most clubbers came when DJ Wannabe A Star started to get deeper into her eclectic music style, while Miss B-have did her parody of a Vegas Showgirl.

Wannabe A Stars mixing skills are flawless, done with the true essence of sensuality. She can play a large variety of music, from hip hop to house, disco to electro, pop to punk rock and back again. 2006 was the year she featured on the tracks ‘Your Shit, My Shit‘ and ‘Mighty My’ collaborating with Benny Sings, Rednose Distrikt and Miss B-have.

2008 is the year of a new collaboration between her and Edu K. La Star who was a resident at Erwin Olafs Fucque Les Balles, touring circus Club Filth and Booty party Little Sexmachine that was born in 2007 and turned Amsterdams Flex Bar in the hottest place on earth. Little Sexmachine was organized by Meubel Stukken.

Looking for new ways to express herself she came across good friend producer Aka Simon Little (STRFCKR/Nevermindthestars). They hit it off straight away. Recording for a year straight, perfecting the sound and show for her as a Band-Artist. 
She likes to create a catchy and dirty sound. Punk meets rock meets pop meets electro. Positive, fun and a high energy live show as a result. Her live show is more a “come together” of different disciplines of art and not only a sexy live performance. While rocking and rolling around with her live band, the show is also supported by the poppy video images made by VJ Alex Kaseta. She and her band are mostly fully dressed in Dutch fashion genius Bas Kosters with whom she organised the infamous Anti Fashion Party during Amsterdam Fashion Week. (They were featured in the 2013 Augusts edition of MixMag.)

On 11-11-11 her debut album ”WANNABEANALBUM” finally came out! The videoclip of “Party Party” and “I Need A Man” went on rotation at MTV’S Brand New. 

Her album received rave reviews in her native Holland, but also got noticed abroad. The Remix Pack “I Need  A Man” was heavily supported by people like Stuart Price (Madonna/Killers), Diplo (Major Lazer), Switch, Tommie Sunshine, Brodinski and many, many more!

Beginning of 2012 Wannabe A Star was weekly featured on national Dutch TV. Where she filmed her private and stage life as part of a documentary style soap opera called Connected.

Wannabe A Star hosted Bavaria’s “Mess With The DJ” tour for the festival season of 2012 (dj & live).  Fall 2012 she toured (live) with travelling festival Popronde all through Holland.

In 2013 she was featured on Joshua Walters first release “Nocturnal Animals” . On 15th of July 2013 the remix package of ” Party Party” was released on STRFCKR RCRDS. Wannabe A Star is currently working on her second album.

Wannabe A Star started working on her electronic project W.A.S. On her Soundcloud you can find her Booty Bass track “The Big D”.

In 2017 she formed an all-girl punk band and they released the cover album ""Greatest Hits"" on Sony Music. With hits like ""I Love Rock 'N Roll"", ""Wanna Be Your Dog"", ""Bohemian Like You"" and many many more. It's a must see!",False,1115,262,50,7,42,38

Bristol based artist Badliana has spent her musical career cultivating her sound and paving the way for her solo career to take flight. With a distinctive, haunting vocal style, Badliana draws on dark electronic sounds such as grime, hip hop & trap and combines this with influence from jazz, soul & r&b. The result is a deeply personal sound and style with Badliana weaving stories of emotional battles, heartbreak and unrestricted resentment within her music.

In 2020, Badliana released her debut single 'Make Me Cry' accompanied by her debut music video which she directed & edited, followed by 'Spiders' which grabbed the attention of BBC Introducing and SWU FM. 

Badliana started 2021 with her release of 'Other Side' and is now preparing for her debut EP, 'Diary Of A Loner', with Saffron Records. The first single being 'Motorola' which will be available on all platforms on April 1st 2021.",False,281,46,9,1,126,4

Setting fire to dancefloors with chopped breaks, deadly deep subs, soundclash mentality and pure euphoria. 

FFF started ""djing"" on 2 turntables (without pitch control) early 90s. Mixing mainly rave, techno and the sparse UK breakbeat hardcore imports that arrived at his local record shops. 
First steps into making music: combining sounds from vinyl mixed with tapeloops, sounds from his sisters keyboard and a lot of feedback. Things changed big time when his parents bought a PC and his friends turned him onto tracker software. 

Mid 90s he started the cassette label ""Orange Socks"" on which he released his own material plus music from his friends and artists he met through tapetrading. He released his first track on vinyl in 2001 (on the French Necromaniacs Industry label) and from then on kept releasing on  a wide range of labels (Planet Mu, Kool.Pop, Murder Channel, Prspct RVLT, Hong Kong Violence, Mindbender, Sozialistischer Plattenbau, Sprengstoff, Clash, K-produktions, Sonic Beligeranza, Ketacore, Encounters, Artcore, Dub Attack, Zero71) His first full length album ""20.000 Hardcore Members Can't Be Wrong"" was released on the Japanese Murder Channel Label in 2011. And the follow up ""Keep The Fire"" in 2013.

In 2001 Bong-Ra & FFF organized the Breakcore a GoGo parties. These became one of the first regular Breakcore nights in Europe. When BCGG ended in 2004, FFF continued to promote breakcore & Jungle on the monthly Wreck havoc nights which never officially stopped and still pop up once in a while. 

FFF is an obsessive vinyl collector. A trip to the record shop, flea market, thrift stores, record fair and the element of surprise that comes with crate digging are most of the times the basic inspiration for a new track. 

Live you can expect amen warfare, hoovers, rave horns and tropical vibes with elements of jungle, rave, bubbling, dancehall and gabber.

The influences of London's pirate stations such as Centre-force, Station FM and Kiss, along with the legendary house parties of the day, helped mould Papa Gee's unique and intriguing flavour matched with his diverse and talented technique, resulting in the interesting and charismatic artist he has become today.

The early influence of Pirate Radio led Papa Gee & Junglist MC to perform live at the Roller Express Bar, giving them the opportunity to perform the supporting sets for The Five + Tenor's which lead them directly to the infamous Jungle Champion Sound Clash where they really made their mark.

By 1996 and with two years playing on Weekend Rush under his belt Papa Gee then went on to Cyndicate FM where he was at the forefront of bringing the Jungle vibes to the region playing with Pure Science, Heat & Sound-clash, to name but a few.

Papa Gee's transition in to the studio was firmly cemented when Different Levels introduced Papa to Rizla & MC Stevie Hyper D (RIP) which resulted in the recordings of 'The First Step' Papa Gee's debut album which was immediately signed to Island Records.

By 1997 Papa Gee was spreading his magic on Kool FM and is still one of the stations long standing much loved DJ's, gracing us with his flavour every Sunday afternoon.

By 1999 Papa Gee & Rampa (Pinnacle) had formed record label DETOX RECORDINGS working along side DJ Magic from the Prisoner of Technology, jumping on board with Rooney & J-Rise this formidable team where a force to be reckoned with.

With first release Calabasas & Dark Life, simultaneously Papa Gee was a resident at Twice As Nice, The Coliseum & The End club whilst being instrumental in the formation of the Tiamat Records with MC Piper, which lead to the release of '4 my dogz + Fun-da-birds & F1' a killer track of the day.

2000's Papa Gee has been rolling as the GO GETTERS with MC Curse and Junglist MC playing at Tenner Fever, Heat & fever, United Dance & Jungle Fever 3, Pure Science, Kool FM Birthday Bash, Telepathy and Pyromaniacs to name but a few. Papa's road trip extended to Athens where he has played many festivals as well.

1768,78066,https://soundcloud.com/daxj,DAX J,,London,GB,"There are few artists carving out a legacy for themselves like Dax J is right now. The London-born, British DJ and producer has gone from pirate radio to magazine covers; from the backroom parties to headlining raves at every major techno institution the world over, and all whilst staying true to the underground and his own individual style. His technical skills and pure selection as a DJ combined with his attention to high-end sound production has placed him at the forefront of a global scene, and established him as a singular presence within modern dance music.
 
Recent accolades for his unswerving devotion to his sound have included places in the top 100 DJs polls published by Resident Advisor, DJ Mag and Groove Magazine. Over the years, he’s also received nominations as Best Techno DJ, Best Breakthrough DJ and Best British DJ from Mixmag, DJ Mag and the DJ Awards. He's renowned for playing mammoth closing sets at monumental parties including 10-hour marathon sets in the world’s most notorious techno clubs, Berghain and Bassiani.

Also known as a prolific producer and successful record label boss, his trademark sound remains in constant rotation among the most respected DJs in dance music. It’s a style that has evolved over many years, but which was first fully recognised on his highly acclaimed 2015 album, ""Shades of Black"". Upon its initial release on his own Monnom Black label, Mixmag named it ""Album of the Month"", Hardwax described it as “brilliantly banging” and it also took the coveted No.1 spot on Juno Records. 2018 saw Dax release his multi-faceted second solo album “Offending Public Morality”. The record won support across the board, including that of BBC Radio 1 who picked it as their “Biggest Record of the Week”. By the end of 2018, “Offending Public Morality” also featured in the “Top 50 Albums of the Year” lists for DJ Mag, Tsugi and Apocalypse Mag. Two more events that crowned a year of great success were his enrolment into the BBC hall of fame with the release of his debut Radio 1 Essential Mix, and Be.At.TV’s choice of his 4-hour closing set at NeoPop Festival for their “Best DJ set of the year”.",True,82246,53,126,16,309,88

Matt “Achilles” Cross was born into a music oriented family with his father formerly being in a largely known Punk band. With the passion for music already ingrained in his being and a middle name like Achilles, he is inevitably set to carry the torch of musical eminence. Matt began DJing in 2015 and promptly shifted into production soon after. Over the years, he has gained recognition from artists such as AC Slater, Jauz, Marten Horger and Dr. Fresch while being booked as support for artists such as 12th Planet, Ghastly, 4B and Herobust. 

Achilles has accumulated multiple Top 100 releases that span various categories, with no end in sight for this eclectic talent. While growing exponentially as an artist, Matt relishes in experimenting with many subgenres of House music, from Bass House to Tech House to Speed House, and even dabbles in the realm of Bass. His intent is to provide an environment that allows patrons to feel carefree and fully release energy on the dance floor through the means of sheer euphoria and stimulating beats. Achilles is certainly one to keep on your radar as he readily paves his way to becoming a widely recognized artist.",True,2907,331,7,10,40,465

Both gentlemen had been involved with music for a long time, in a short time Zwart-Wit knew the best to mention their name. With over 12000 plays on soundcloud and their number of dropped tracks on all music platforms. Zwart-Wit is trying to confirm their name and that is definitely the right way. artists from all countries are already approaching the two gentlemen. They have released a track with an upcoming Latin / Rapper and songwirther Zairah and have many more with other producers.

1806,123184,https://soundcloud.com/carlnunes,Carl Nunes,Carl  Nunes,Paris,GT,"For proof that dance music is a truly global affair, you need look no further than Guatemalan DJ Carl Nunes, who’s won fans across the world with dozens of gigs in China, India and Indonesia in 2017 as part of his Limitless Tour, alongside shows in Vegas, Mexico and riotous homecoming shows in Latin America.

“Apart from producing and collaborating with other artists, I have been learning from other cultures,” says Nunes of his global adventures.

One look at his social media pages confirms that Carl Nunes is an artist immersed in global culture — from walking the Great Wall of China to exploring the back streets of Bali and Hong Kong, he’s made an effort to go beyond the nightclubs while on tour.

But when he’s behind the decks and creating in his studio, his music speaks the universal dancefloor language. “I’ve been trying to absorb and assimilate as much as possible, creating my own mix-match of concepts and perceptions of the world,” Nunes tells us.

The results have been impressive, with Armada releasing his tropical hit ‘White Dress’ earlier in the year, a more chilled counter-point to earlier releases like the huge hit ‘Out Of My Mind’.

Smartly following up the duo delivered a steady output of releases and doubled down on their studio focus, resulting in a breakthrough year of music in 2020.

""THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECH HOUSE""

“VIBRATION” on Sink Or Swim, became their first #1 Track, topping the Tech House Top 100 on Beatport as well as extended stay in the #2 position in the Overall Top 100. A strong run of consecutive Top 10 releases firmly cemented their place among the Top 10 selling Tech House artists on Beatport alongside heavyweights like Eli Brown, Chris Lake, and Martin Ikin.

""DO NOT BLINK""

With the momentum building, Tomorrowland named DONT BLINK one of their Future 4 artists in April of 2021. The distinction brought a compelling opportunity for the duo to showcase their sound and preview the next chapter of music ahead with their mix and feature. A forthcoming onslaught of brand new tracks will see releases on STEREOHYPE, SOLOTOKO, Night Bass, and Armada Deep, among others. Taken together with their diverse range of support from Tech House stars like James Hype, Idris Elba, and Sam Divine, alongside dance music legends like Afrojack, Diplo, Laidback Luke, and Tiësto, it’s time for DONT BLINK’s touring schedule to take over dancefloors worldwide.

They first met in '93 DJ'ing with the infamous Smokescreen Sound System, and in '98 their label, Drop Music, was born with the release of 'Inland Knights Vol 1'.  This marked the beginning of a prolific production  schedule  which saw their work on labels such as 20/20 vision, NRK, OM Records, Cheeky, Amenti, Vista and more recently Miguel Campbell’s Outcross Recordings.

Straight out the North East of England!

NSA gave birth to MICKEYRAE out of the bass bin in 2014 and he climbed out armed with a USB full of weapons-grade bangers. First dabbling in dubwise drum and bass and eventually becoming consumed by the jungle, his natural talent behind the decks, relentlessly positive attitude and endlessly high levels of energy made him an absolute staple of any party. Whilst smashing the life out of every rave within his reach he eventually began production after finding his true calling; jungletekno. By putting his own heavy spin on the genre by lending from scatty new-school jungle MICKEYRAE combines frantic high octane breaks with hefty, thumping hardtek kicks to create a style that can only be described as monstrous. Despite being a relative newcomer, MICKEYRAE's achievements, enthusiasm and boundless potential have solidified him as a serious name to look out for.

""Somewhere on the outskirts of Dallas, Texas, there sits a dude furiously cranking out loud & aggressive electronic noises which--much to the displeasure of the vast majority of the world's population--he and many others consider ""music"".

This dude, also code-named ""NeoQor"", has managed to commandeer several high-powered audio systems, projecting this dangerous noise from atop stages in every corner of the United States & into hundreds of thousands of ear cavities all over the world, dealing insurmountable levels of damage to hearing and general sense of safety.

This so-called ""music”, has been deemed a menace to society and a public health hazard by authorities, as it has been shown to induce undesirable effects in its listeners. Such effects include:
-Uncontrollable body spasms
-Gratuitous whistle-tooting
-Unsolicited ""collab bro?'s""
-Inappropriate fist-pumping
-Phat hakk-chucking
-Street brawls
...and the occasional case of melted face.

And yet---this dude does not stop. Like a machine, he continues on relentlessly, cranking out more and more of this ""extreme rave music"" unblinkingly and without any hesitation or second thoughts.

God help us all...""",False,1518,954,59,12,2700,1181

bio:
In his native Ayr, in Scotland, Ewan McVicar revitalised the town’s club culture, sparking a movement that remains fervent and committed, four years since it was first formed. This is typical of Ewan’s community-focused outlook. Still a relative newcomer to the international circuit, his commitment to building a local scene in Ayr, combined with his DJ skills and fearless approach to production make Ewan one of the most promising artists of his generation. Nominated in the Breakthrough DJ category at the DJ Mag Best of British Awards in 2020, he is ascending rapidly up the ranks. Already a core member of Patrick Topping’s Trick collective, and the brains behind his own mini empire, this early success is a sure-fire sign of things to come. Hungry, determined and full of good vibes for all, Ewan McVicar is primed for the next phase of his burgeoning career…",True,8474,202,35,9,593,308

1989,14810,https://soundcloud.com/audiofreakcult,Aud!o DNB,Audio,London,GB,"No other producer packs a punch like AUDIO. From his tattooed drum & bass knuckles to his ruthlessly hard-hitting productions, Gareth Greenall embodies the spirit of D&B. Uncompromising, inherently underground and refusing to play games, the South London artist’s diligence, creativity and lack of complacency has inspired mass respect from every possible corner of the scene.

Four albums, countless 12”s and over 15 years deep into his limit-pushing adventures, Gareth continues to surge at the very forefront of the sound he’d first experienced as young Londoner tuning in to Colin Dale’s eminent Abstract Dance Kiss FM sermons. Instant jungle entrenchment: he hurled himself into the fray. Vinyls, Reason, illegal raves… The boy – whose mum brought him up on a strict diet of ABBA and Queen – grabbed any angle and any opportunity to get involved.
From ringing up and booking Ed Rush for a party above a pub in Croydon off the back of mobile number on a test press … To scoring a job as in-house studio engineer at legendary rave distributors Alphamagic where he studied the dark art of dynamics at a masters level: Audio wouldn’t – and still won’t – settle for anything less than full immersion.

His own production stripes stretch back to just after the turn of the century when he found himself at the helm of Resonant Evil. Demonstrating their power with a debut on the genre-defining Renegade Hardware, over the course of two years they scorched the repertoires of Moving Shadow, G2 and Outbreak. As Resonant Evil’s brutal bulletins wound down, Audio was winding up. Carving his own path with his own rules, he was soon snapped up by early neuro pioneers Tech Freak Recordings who gave him the opportunity to stretch himself creatively and broadcast his first long playing message. Audio’s debut album ‘To The Edge Of Reason’ showed the world he could cater for experiences beyond the dancefloor yet convey the same attitude and defiant dynamic he’d become synonymous with as a DJ and on 12”s. It was so well received; within a year he was signed by Ed Rush and Optical and for five years became an intrinsic member of the Virus family.

Audio’s work on Virus is where he really developed momentum. Already an established headliner across Europe, his productions and reputation became a global phenomenon, leading to tours in every territory. This reputation was compounded by albums such as ‘Genesis Device’ and ‘Soul Magnet’ which spawned the mighty ‘Headroom’. One of the most influential and successful tracks of its time, it knocked chart-topping EDM star Avicii off the Beatport top spot, dominating the chart for a total of 13 weeks and setting the foundation for his final Virus album ‘Force Of Nature’. Released in October 2013, it threw the scene completely off-guard… No other producer has conjured two albums of such strong-armed quality within less than a year. Just as his debut album had pricked the ears of Virus, ‘Force Of Nature’ attracted Andy C’s Ram Records.

Kindred spirits, Audio and Ram Records are a natural fit: both D&B lifers, both as emphatic and enthusiastic about the scene as they were at inception, both dedicated to pushing drum & bass to its furthest limits creatively and sonically, Audio’s decorated career has leveled up once more. To Gareth, though, it’s business as usual; still immersed in production science (now using the unique Studio One set up) and still just as buzzed about slapping a dancefloor into submission with deadly double drops as he was when he kicked off, Audio’s unique punch is harder than it’s ever been.",True,44591,31,102,10,14,0
